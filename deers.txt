I mean, yeah, let's focus only on the evolution of deer population. You could consider that its per year delta is basically the difference between net growth rate and the predation rate. Now, the net growth rate could be something like the product of a growth rate factor and the deer population. In itself, the growth rate factor could itself be a piecewise linear function of the ratio between food per deer with the initial food per deer. Obviously, the value of food per deer could be computed as a ratio between the volume of food and the deer population. What's missing... oh of course, the predation rate. Well, this one could be something like the product of the predator population size and the average number of deer killed by a given predator. For the latter, I think a piecewise linear function of the ratio between deer density (deer population divided by the area size, obviously) and initial deer density would be appropriately representative to show that it's more complex than a basic product. Also, regarding the predator population, I think a step function of time ought to do it. Hmm, I'd think everything is in there, although some constants are required: let's say the food volume is 100000 units, also we could use 1000000 as size of the considered area used to compute the density, the initial deer density could be like 0.005 and the initial food per deer could be 20 units.
